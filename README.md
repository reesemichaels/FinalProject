# FinalProject
 This project will attempt to examine associations between receiving stats like Y/R, TDs, first downs, catch %, etc.
 and environmental factors like weather (temperature and wind) and surface for the 2023 NFL regular season.
 
# Research Question
 Do temperature, wind speed, or playing surface impact team receiving statistics?

## Datasets
I acquired data using the following datasets:
- receiver catch player-level data
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/receiving.htm

- historical game log game-level data
