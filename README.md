# FinalProject
 This project will attempt to create a model to predict the effects of select variables (stadium location, weather, opponent secondary rank)
 on NFL receiver catch rate for the 2023 NFL season.

## Datasets
I will need the following datasets:
- receiver catch data
- weather logs
- stadium location for each game
- opponent secondary ranking

## Implementation
I have limited experience with regression models, so I will need to research which model best fit the data I have selected. My initial impression is that 
a Random Forest model may work best because of the numerical and categorical nature of the selected datasets.
